## About Me

I'm a Senior Full Stack Developer with over 10 years of experience, specializing in Python, Django, React, Node.js, and AWS. I’m skilled in both front-end and back-end development, enabling me to build and manage solid, high-performance web applications.

On the back end, I focus on Python and Django, creating secure APIs and handling complex database tasks. On the front end, I use React to develop user interfaces that are both attractive and easy to use. My experience with Node.js helps me create full-stack solutions that work well across different platforms.

I’ve also deployed and managed applications on AWS, using services like EC2, S3, Lambda, and RDS to ensure they run smoothly and can grow as needed. I work well with teams to deliver projects that meet client needs, bringing a strong work ethic and a commitment to high-quality results.
